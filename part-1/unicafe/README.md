# Unicafe

The task was to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback for the University of Helsinki Unicafe, with only three options: good, neutral, and bad. Once the first feedback is given, the application displays some statistics data.

The app works during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback disappears.
