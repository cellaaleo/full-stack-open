# Unicafe

The task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback for the University of Helsinki Unicafe, with only three options: good, neutral, and bad, and then display the total number of feedback for each category.

The app works during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback disappears.
